# Project #1 Part #2: System Calls

Note that you must repeat the process below for every CPU architecture.

### Initial Steps

1. Move into the directory with the Debian hard drive image.

        cd 'syscall-project/debian/<arch>'

2. Start Debian Linux in QEMU.

        ./start.sh

3. Start a new shell instance.

4. Copy the `ish` directory from your machine to the emulated system with `scp` or git.

5. Login into the Debian system through SSH. Use the login that you have specified during the installation process.

        ssh -p 2222 <login>@127.0.0.1

6. Go into the directory `ish`.

   In this task, you need to perform a number of system calls to the Linux kernel without the help of any standard libraries.

   The calls are

        read
        chdir
        exit
        stat
        open
        creat
        dup2
        close
        fork
        execve
        waitpid
        write

   You have sources of a simple shell that performs the calls above with the help of a system library.

   Your task is to implement functions

        ish_read
        ish_chdir
        ish_exit
        ish_stat
        ish_open
        ish_creat
        ish_dup2
        ish_close
        ish_fork
        ish_execve
        ish_waitpid
        ish_write

   in `ish_syscalls.<arch>.c` to perform the system calls to the kernel directly on your own. That will remove the dependency on the system library for the shell at hand.

   Open documentation files for each related system call to get information about return values and parameter types.

        man 2 read
        man 2 write
        ...

   Library type definitions can be replaced with the following

        typedef size_t  unsigned long
        typedef ssize_t long
        typedef pid_t   int

   The `struct stat` from `sys/stat.h` for the `stat` system call can be replaced with an array large enough to contain file information from the kernel (as we are only interested in the return code). For an invalid pointer to a `struct stat`, the `stat` system call always returns an error.

        char stat[1024];

   Test each custom system call function by replacing a related standard library call in `ish.c` with a call to your new implementation. When everything is ready and works as expected, return the old system call names in `ish.c` and remove the `-D ISH_USE_STDLIB` preprocessor definition from the project's Makefile. Your shell will use the new calls after that. You can always switch back by adding the definition back.

   Not all system calls are available on all hardware platforms. In certain cases, you will have to find a replacement and adjust the arguments in registers to perform the operation. For example, you may have to replace `stat` with `fstatat` or `open` with `openat`. To find which calls to use, you can write a small C program to perform the call from C and then analyze the assembly generated by the compiler. GNU Debugger could be useful in that particular case.

```c
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 128
static char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

int main(int argc, char **argv[])
{
    /* All the ISH system calls in one place to disassemble them */

    int int_res __attribute__((used));
    ssize_t long_res __attribute__((used));

    long_res = read(0, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);

    int_res = chdir("/tmp");

    struct stat statbuf;
    int_res = stat("/bin/true", &statbuf);

    int fd_open = open("/bin/false", 00000);

    int fd_creat = creat("/tmp/test.txt", 00644);

    int_res = dup2(fd_creat, 1);

    int_res = close(fd_open); int_res = close(fd_creat);

    pid_t pid;
    if ((pid = fork()) > 0) {
        int status;
        pid = waitpid(pid, &status, 0);
    } else {
        int_res = execve("/bin/ls", NULL, NULL);

        exit(42);
    }

    long_res = write(1, buffer, strnlen(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE));

    exit(43);

    return 0;
}
```

### Managing Sources and Executables

* Edit the code. Add implementation for every system call in files `ish_syscall.<arch>.c`. Change related system call names in `ish.c` to the newly implemented function names (e.g., change `read` to `ish_read`).

        vim ish_syscalls.<arch>.c
        vim ish.c

* Build or rebuild the shell.

        make

* Test the shell by typing built-in commands such as `cd` and `exit`. Try to start various system programs such as `ls` or `date` with an absolute path to the executable or without it, with parameters or without them. Try to redirect standard input or output streams with `<` and `>` operators.

        ./ish
        /bin/ls
        /bin/ls -l /etc

  press `CTRL+C` to exit

        ./ish
        cd
        ls
        exit

        ./ish
        date
        exit

        ./ish
        cd /tmp
        ls > listing.txt
        cat < listing.txt
        exit 1

  Note that we have a toy shell that does not know how to do a lot of things. You will not be able to edit your input. You will not be able to use piping. Autocomplete of commands is not available here.

  To test a specific system call, you will have to figure out which action in the shell utilizes that particular call under test.

* Remove compiled files.

        make clean
