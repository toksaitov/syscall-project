# Project #1, Part #1, GNU/Linux on AMD64

## Getting Access to a GNU/Linux Machine

First, create an isolated x86-64 GNU/Linux environment through QEMU virtualization and emulation system. You should try your best to run QEMU as virtualization software if you have an x86-64 host environment. You should run it as an emulator otherwise.

If you have an x86-64 CPU and you have virtualization technologies enabled in the settings of your firmware (BIOS, UEFI), edit the following files in `platforms/amd64`:

* `start.sh`
* `start_installation.sh`

In every file, you should replace the word `tcg` on line 17 or 23 with

* `whpx,kernel-irqchip=off` if you are on Windows 10+ and have Hyper-V [enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v)
* `hax` if you are on Windows 7+ with an Intel CPU and have [Intel HAXM](https://github.com/intel/haxm) hypervisor installed
* `hvf` if you are on macOS 10.10+
* `kvm` if you are on GNU/Linux and have the `qemu-kvm` package installed

If you can't enable virtualization on your computer or are using lab machines, leave the `tcg` on line 17 or 23 as is in all those files. Be prepared that QEMU will run as an emulator. The emulation process is slow compared to virtualization. The steps below may take a considerable amount of time.

Now with or without virtualization, start following the steps below.

1. Move into the project directory `./syscall-project/`.

        cd 'syscall-project/'

2. Download the hardware emulator QEMU for your operating system.

        # On Windows (from the Bash shell bundled with Git)
        ./utilities/download_qemu_win64.sh

        # On macOS with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
        brew install qemu

        # On Ubuntu Linux
        sudo apt install curl qemu-system

3. Move into the directory `./platforms/amd64`.

        cd 'platforms/amd64/'

4. Download the Debian installation disk.

        ./utilities/download_debian.sh

5. Download the UEFI image for QEMU.

        ./utilities/download_firmware.sh

6. Create a new hard drive image file to store the installed system.

        ./utilities/create_disk_image.sh

7. Start the emulator and the installation process. It is important to try to use hardware virtualization in this step. The QEMU `start_installation.sh`, `start.sh`,  and

        ./start_installation.sh

8. Select the `Install` option and NOT the `Graphical Install` option in the bootloader. Use `Arrow`-keys or `Backspace` to select items on the screen. Follow the steps below to install the system. Note that it is recommended to close QEMU after the first successful reboot during the installation process and boot Debian for the first time with the `./start.sh` script.

## Starting and Stopping the System

If the system is not running, you can start the QEMU emulator and Debian with the following command

```bash
./start.sh
```

If you can not start the emulator on Windows, ensure the QEMU executable location is in the `$PATH` environment variable.

```bash
echo $PATH

# If the QEMU directory is not there, from `platforms/amd64/` execute
export PATH=$PATH:`cd ../../qemu; pwd`
```

To shut down the system and exit from QEMU

```bash
# After you have started the system and logged-in with the user name
# and password specified during the installation process
sudo systemctl poweroff
```

## Installing Additional Software

1. Start the system and log in.

2. Install the GNU C compiler, the GNU Make build system, the GNU Debugger, and the Git version control system.

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install gcc make gdb git

3. Shut down the system.

## Fixing Networking Issues [Optional]

1. If you experience connectivity issues in the emulated environment, try disabling the IPv6 support in the kernel.

        sudo nano /etc/default/grub

2. Append `ipv6.disable=1` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` variable and save the file.

3. Update the GRUB boot loader.

        sudo update-grub

4. Restart the system.

        sudo systemctl reboot

## Cleanup [Optional]

1. Compress the virtual hard drive image file to save some space on your computer.

        ./utilities/compress_disk_image.sh

2. Remove the old uncompressed disk image.

        ./utilities/remove_old_files.sh
